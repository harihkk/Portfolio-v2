# Public Content Review

Every public claim rendered on the site, mapped to its provenance record and approval status. Verified 2026-06-21 against the commit SHAs in [commit-shas.md](audit/commit-shas.md). Nothing with `publicApproved: false` is rendered anywhere, those items are listed under "Held, not rendered."

The machine-readable source of truth is [`content/provenance.ts`](../content/provenance.ts). A unit test (`tests/unit/content.test.ts`) asserts the phone number never appears in any record and that held items stay unapproved.

## Employer record (résumé-sourced; flagged for sign-off)

## Status labels

`published` (DebugBrief, PyPI), `active` (Helm v0.2, working local app), `alpha` (Code Review Arena v0.1.0 / ContamCheckr v0.1.0). A unit test asserts only DebugBrief carries `published`.

## Research relationships

All 14 Research Desk papers are labeled **External paper**, `authoredByHari: false`, `recordType: READING`. Metadata (title, full author list, arXiv ID, dates, category) was fetched and verified against the arXiv API on 2026-06-21 (queries recorded in [raw-audit](audit/raw-audit-2026-06-21.json)). The "relationship" text is a neutral relevance note, never a first-person Hari annotation. The Preprints area is intentionally empty (no authored manuscript is claimed).

## Education

| Claim | Source | Approved |
|---|---|---|
| M.S. Data Analytics Engineering (ML), Northeastern, May 2025 | `edu-ms` (résumé) | ✅ |
| Undergraduate degree/dates |  | 🚫 held (no verified source) |

## External links (all `target="_blank"` carry `rel="noopener noreferrer"`; verified by e2e)

GitHub profile + 4 flagship repos; DebugBrief on PyPI; Prompt-Budd live (`promtbud.com`, confirmed 200); AskRC/GenBI/Visioncraft/self-healing-pipeline repos; 14 arXiv URLs; résumé PDF (`/Hari_K_Resume_AI_SWE.pdf`, served 200). Earlier-work "Live" links are shown only when the deployment actually responds (`liveVerified`).
